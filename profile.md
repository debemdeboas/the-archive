# about me

site reliability engineer who keeps things running and occasionally writes code that doesn't break everything.

if you need someone to keep your infrastructure from falling over or automate the boring stuff away, [ping me](mailto:rafael.bem@debem.dev).

## what i do

currently doing sre stuff at tk elevator, which means i spend my days:

- keeping a global embedded cluster alive (it has custom pcbs and proprietary software, because why make life easy)
- writing python tools that make other people's jobs less tedious
- deploying monitoring stacks so i know when things break before everyone starts screaming
- building auto recovery solutions, need i say more
- writing ci/cd pipelines that actually work

before that i did similar things at loggi (logistics) and nelogica (fintech).
turns out keeping systems running is pretty much the same everywhere - just different flavors of chaos.

## tech stuff

languages i actually use
: python, go, c, bash, sql, assembly

languages i pretend to know
: cuda, javascript, zig, haskell, cpp

\

infrastructure things
: docker, kubernetes, aws/gcp/azure, on-prem, terraform, ansible

monitoring things
: grafana, prometheus, influxdb, opentelemetry

ci/cd things
: gitlab ci, github actions, bamboo, jenkins, argocd

these are all in no particular order.

## education & research

doing an m.s. in computer science at pucrs, focusing on deep learning research.
trying to make ai less biased.

finished my b.s. in 2024 after the pandemic made everything take longer than expected (thanks, 2020---2023).

## projects i'm proud of

the archive
: this blog you're reading. go-based, has ed25519 auth, real-time updates, and a design philosophy that ignores trends.

reinforcement learning
: training agents to think step-by-step like humans do. still figuring out if this actually works (doesn't seem like it).

pyllnu
: python library for low-level networking. people actually download it (150+ times/month), which is wild.

home lab
: multi-node cluster running everything from kubernetes to home assistant to 3d printers. 50+ iot devices because apparently i hate having money.

## other stuff

i speak english, portuguese, and italian fluently.
have too many certifications from when i thought they mattered.
located in porto alegre, brazil.
